### The challenge

Selling personal work online as an artist involves a lot of complexity and a logistical nightmare. Having your own site is one solution but not always the best. Deco aimed to solve this dilemma by creating a marketplace for art enthusiasts to buy art, in a unique experience that allows them to see art in a room before they buy. On the artist’s side, Deco would manage the printing and logistics element while giving full authority to the artists over pricing, marketing and selecting how a print could be purchased.

### The approach

To design a website that removes the mystery around how art might look on your wall before buying, and to create a user experience for the artist that gives them confidence in adding artwork to a store that will automate the production of their pieces.
