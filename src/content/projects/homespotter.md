### The approach

HomeSpotter was built on a simple idea: to help real estate agents collaborate easily with their clients on-the-go, with a personalized experience that helps them stand out.

We built branded mobile apps and created automated marketing tools to help promote their listings across major social channels.

### The challenge

HomeSpotter was one of the first companies to provide mobile app solutions to real estate agents, and brokers, enabling them to view and manage listings on-the-go.

As the mobile landscape quickly developed, we were pushed to expand our offerings further to help agents market their listings. We designed solutions to market seller listings through our automated Boost product, saving agents time and money while bringing their listing to a wider buying audience.
