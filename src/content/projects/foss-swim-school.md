### The approach

FOSS Swim School is a family owned business, with a 25+ year history of teaching people how to swim. As they looked to expand into new areas, a realignment in how they position their brand was needed to convey how learning to swim can enable us to live a more complete life.  
  
The opportunity to establish FOSS as a leader in swim education included refreshing the logo and brand with new positioning, redesign the website, build out new educational marketing materials, to tell the story of The Swim Path.

### The challenge

It started with designing children's t-shirts based off the FOSS swim techniques. It quickly expanded into a redesign of the site and building a new and improved system for showing what stage a swimmer is at in their journey.
