Yesterday at 11:05 am I hopped on a 15-minute call with a reader who came across an article I wrote online.

​This person was forwarded my personal website article and then booked a time to chat from my site.

​For some of you, this flow isn't unique.

​Yet, this serendipity engine feels like magic to me.

​This past week, three strangers have reached out this way.

​In the past year, 87,700 people have visited my personal site, and I have had hundreds of calls from people worldwide with little effort.

Many have become clients.

​Some are friends.

​Some are future question marks.

​Some have silently joined and read this here [newsletter](/newsletter).

​What people get wrong about personal sites is they think they are just digital business cards, and not worth investing in.

​Or they are nothing more than a digital journal.

​Both of these can be true if that's what you design them to be.

​But I'd argue there is a more thoughtful way to build a site essential to getting you what you want.

​And it's not about having a home page no one reads, a blog with an apology post stating you hope to write more, and a generic contact form destined never to be filled out.

​All while using your web host's default black-and-white theme with zero personality except for the picture of you and your pets.

​Websites work for hundreds of millions of businesses. So why is your personal website not taking cues from that world?

​Choosing what you want in your life is a key part of this equation, and how your site is structured depends on your choice.**​**

**I believe there are three paths to choose from:**

**Personal Serendipity:** You feel intellectually isolated and desire to expand your social circle, increasing luck and serendipity in your life.**​**

**Professional Pivot:** You're bored with your current career, and want a low-risk way to test out other areas of interest without blowing up your life (and paycheck).

**​Solo Business:** You want to sell products or services and build your solo business by attracting the right clients.

​Which path are you on for [your own site](/courses/personal-website)?
