I was 11 and my brother and I finally stopped sharing a bedroom.

When we got our own rooms, our parents embraced our creativity and let us paint our rooms however we wanted.

On two of my walls, I painted alternating stripes of white and baby blue.

The other two walls I took a paint brush fully dipped in baby blue and whipped it carelessly at the wall like an anxious pitcher making his first start in the big leagues.

I personalized everything.

Now as an adult, I still love to personalize everything.

My restored ‘83 Schwinn. My travel bag. My personal website.

It’s why this newsletter is called Make It Yours.

Now, the creativity I had painting my bedroom as an 11-year old is now my personal website.

It's what drives my personal and professional curiosities.

It's the constant in my life full of change.

I landed my very first job because I had a website.

And it's the source of income that has driven well over $1 million in revenue and friendships from freelancing, side projects, products, and services over the years.

Sure, it's changed over the years as my goals have changed—but it's mine.

And I'll show you the path to creating a personal site that won’t stay silent.

**The perfect personal website doesn't exist.**

But that’s the great thing about it. It can be deployed to your advantage, based on where you want to go.

Whether you want to build personal serendipity because you feel intellectually isolated, change your career because you're stuck, or run a solo business by selling products and services.

I've done all of these, and there are different approaches to each.

2025 is the year to build your personal site and change your life.

I'll be announcing a brand new workshop before the end of December and give you the blueprint for your personal website heading into 2025.
