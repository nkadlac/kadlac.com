        How many times have you thought about launching your own personal website, but put it off because you're too busy, or because it takes too much work to keep updated?
      </p>

      <p>
        Or if you're like me, you're constantly thinking about redesigning it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sure, it's easy to go get a pre-baked template and fill it in, but that almost always leaves you unsatisfied with the result because it doesn't connect with you personally.
      </p>

      <p>
        So instead, you let it sit there gathering dust.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maybe the last time you wrote a post on it was five years ago, knowing if you just had the time to keep it updated, it would start making money or getting attention.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine having a personal website that feels fresh, is branded to you, and gives you new ways to create serendipity or dollars.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whichever path you want to take.
      </p>

      <p class="font-medium text-brand-brown">
        That's why there's not one perfect personal website.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your goals are different than mine.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm Nate Kadlac, and I've used my own personal website to sell products, share my ideas, get clients, change jobs, and create lifelong friendships.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've hosted sites everywhere. I've seen it all.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'll first host a workshop on how to give you the plan for building your own modern personal website that delivers on your goals. Whether it's selling products and courses, making friends, driving leads, or selling services, a personal site can do anything you want it to.
      </p>

      <p>
        It just requires you leaning into what you want, and some guidance.
      </p>

      <p>
        I wouldn't sell my site and domain for $1,000,000. It's generated that and more in my own career.
      </p>

      <p>
        One that I have reinvented a few times over.
      </p>

      <p>
        And when I'm ready, I want to show you how to create a personal website that will generate serendipity, dollars, and opportunity for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your choice.
