Helping real estate agents keep their clients happy by designing products at [HomeSpotter](http://homespotter.com "HomeSpotter").

I'm also making vids over at the [YouTube's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXyF7Or3OX7zXa-z2CVg_Yw) about living small in San Francisco.

If you're looking for some design guidance, I am available to take on small freelance projects, so please take a peek at some work [here](http://dribbble.com/natekadlac "Dribbble Portfolio"), and [here](https://www.behance.net/natekadlac "Behance Portfolio").
