    <p>Train Brain was the very first mobile app that I worked on collaboratively, but the reason I include here in my portfolio is because it’s special to me and it was purely a love project.</p>

<p>It was the first native mobile app in the Twin Cities area, which has a decent transit system, but was far behind the time in terms of offering a mobile solution.</p>

<p>To give some context, there were only a handful of navigation apps available, and in the Twin Cities—Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota for those of you not in the know—we wanted to play towards the power users. At the time, there was no live GPS monitoring on the buses.</p>

<p>Our Solution:
To target power users who take the bus every day, and give them a tool that would be able to locate the nearest (or favorite) bus stop, and it would show a countdown timer based on the schedule.</p>

<p>We felt that looking up stops near you was a very difficult task in its own right, and then finding when the next available bus was coming was something that took the average user well over 2 minutes to do.</p>

<p>The first thing that you see when opening the app is choosing the direction of the route that you’re on, and then you’re able to see the nearby stops on that specific route. From there, you can select the stops and see exactly when the next bus is supposed to arrive.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, this took a lot of work to download the very limited schedule published online, and slowly deconstruct the enormous schedule with updated times. However, our app was just as reliable as the published schedules, which gave us confidence in what we are building.</p>

<p>The app is still being updated and worked on by another developer, and has now expanded into multiple cities and offers both free and paid versions.</p>
