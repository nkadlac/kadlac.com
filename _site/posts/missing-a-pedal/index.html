    <p>The first day into my 600 mile bike trip, I looked down and realized my pedal had just fallen off.</p>

<p>“Fuck!”</p>

<p>I slammed on the brakes as my loose foot hit the pavement.</p>

<p>Just moments earlier, I thought to myself, “What’s the worst that could happen, a flat tire?”</p>

<p>We were stuck outside Montreal, where nothing was open at 6 AM. This was a lifeless suburbia, where every home looks identical. It was too early to walk around knocking on stranger’s doors, knowing the chance of someone speaking English was slim to none.</p>

<p>I immediately tried to retrace the steps from the night before, to when I was putting the pieces of my bike together. Where did I go wrong?</p>

<p>Maybe I had rushed the process. After all, we did get our bikes from customs a day late, and had to deal with the anxiety of never having shipped my bike in a box before.</p>

<p>I walked back 20 feet in disbelief, as the pedal just sat in the empty street.</p>

<p>After inspecting the pedal and crank, half of the threads were stripped.</p>

<p>In that moment, I realized that the night before, I must have tightened the pedal slightly off-center. Each downstroke of the pedal, I was slowly stripping away the threads.</p>

<p>“We need to find an adjustable wrench,” Eric said.</p>

<p>Holding the fallen pedal in one hand, pedaling the bike with one foot, and trying to balance a bike loaded with gear for a 12 day trip, looked as silly as you can imagine.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll get lucky.”</p>

<p>3 miles of one-legged pedaling, we arrive at a small convenience store where the clerk only speaks French. After struggling to explain our situation, he doesn’t have have a single tool that might help us.</p>

<p>We left slightly discouraged, headed to the closest grocery store with Google’s big red arrow leading the way. The pedal in my hand was clenched a lot tighter now.</p>

<p>Inside, after unsuccessfully speaking with a couple workers, I was pointed to a warehouse manager who happened to speak a little English.</p>

<p>All he had were needle-nose pliers, which left me a little worried that we might be delaying our trip a day or two. Newport, Vermont was still over 10 hours away, so we couldn’t waste anymore time.</p>

<p>Not about to turn down his offer, I walked outside to give it a try, and carefully held the pedal as it wobbled into place. While slowly tightening the nut with a tool meant for jewelry designers, the four remaining threads barely held together the pedal to the crank.</p>

<p>Testing the bike out around the parking lot gave me a sense of hope for the day, but wondering if the pedal might fall off at any given moment was a source of anxiety for the rest of the trip.</p>

<p>Despite the headwinds of Vermont, the climbs into the Adirondack Mountains, and along the tips of the Finger Lakes, my busted pedal never failed on me. And whenever I find myself hanging on by a thread, my mind drifts back to that ride.</p>
