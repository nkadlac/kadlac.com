# My Favorite Book

I didn’t start reading until a little later in life. That’s not to say that I didn’t read at all before, but it was sporadic. I remember picking up The Tin Drum when I was 22, based on a recommendation by Martha, a girl I was nuts about. Of course I was going to read anything she told me too. 

I remember reading as a kid, but only for a few years. School had us read a few books—like the Grapes of Wrath—but I felt that I was able to skip a lot of those somehow. It’s funny that I don’t quite remember.

Reading took second seat to art and sports. I also thought highly of that combination, and continued telling people that later in life. 

“Yeah, crazy that a guy likes sports and art, huh?” Wow, was that lame. 

The book that I can look back on that I enjoyed reading daily  was The Fountainhead. I was 29 and staying in San Francisco for a month. I was perched high up in a window sill, and didn’t even leave the house much. This book captivated me. For the first week, I was traveling with Julie and Pete through wine country to the screams of their 6 mo old in the back seat. I remember Pete saying, ”How can you read a book while riding in a car, which a screaming kid in your ear?” I also took pride in that.

In the past 3 months, I’ve read 9 books. Times have changed. I don’t look back and say that books have played an important part because there aren’t many that act as a reference point for my youth. 

I’ll answer this question for a book I read recently. The autobiography of Malcom X. That book left me in tears, giving me an example of how to hold myself to a higher standard. Knowing that a man was incarcerated for a crime, and used that obstacle to change his entire being. “Lean into it” they say. That motherfucker leaned into life as much as he could when given the  chance. I think about that book almost every day.
